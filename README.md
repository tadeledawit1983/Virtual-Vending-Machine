# Virtual-Vending-Machine

I have created in the folder for front-end and back-end development. For front-end I used React and CSS for style and for back-end I used Node/Express and MongoDB to store data. Before run the application the node server supposed to be started. Run the following command on terminal nodemon server.js or node server.js from your text editor.

on this web application on the header (nav bar) there is fore different soda item displayed on the screen when the user click on the Buy button browser will display that single item and user will have the option to download the receipt {json file} by clicking Download Recipt button or navigate to home by clicking on 'continue Shopping link'.

On the navigation bar from right side there is the admin link that takes to another route that the admin or owner to add or update existing item. To add or update item admin should have to login first. After login the route will take to another page that have two options, one for the update and the other for update items in stock. And admin has an access to see all stock by clicking "Click here to see all stock." link. i am usin axios for http request to get post and update item from stock (mongoDB)
